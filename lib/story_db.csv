1,"July, 1947",dawn,"the crime scene, Santa Monica pier",,,"It has been a relentless, hot summer. But it has not been one for enjoying the weather with friends and family, cold beer in hand, grilling burgers and hot dogs.

The citizens of LA have been terrorized by an unknown killer who dismembers his victims, leaving body parts around the city. The first victim was found only last month. A woman’s torso was found in a suitcase by the janitor of an elementary school, left beside a dumpster. A hand was mailed to the LAPD, the package reeking of rotting flesh, soaked in blood. The victim has not yet been identified.

But the killer is at it again. This time, a note has been left behind, and the body part found is the other hand. It has been presumed that it must be from the same body. Both hands have similar characteristics. The left hand had an indent where a wedding ring probably sat. This was a woman who enjoyed doing her nails, as they were immaculate and painted with precision.

It is 6:24am. A call came in to the LAPD by a woman in hysterics. She was out walking her dog along the Santa Monica pier. Her dog wouldn’t leave a particular spot alone, despite her best efforts to pull him away. When she finally went to see what the dog was making a fuss over, she made the grisly discovery.

The ocean air tickles your nose with saltiness, the air is thick and dense. You are looking at the letter that lay under the severed hand. It is not handwritten. Rather, it is compiled of letters from multiple different sources, newspapers and the like.

YOU KNOW THIS IS SO MUCH FUN
THIS KILLING BUSINESS
IT IS MUCH MORE ENTERTAINING
THAN KILLING ANIMALS IN THE FOREST
BETTER THAN AN ICE COLD BEER ON A HOT DAY
OR GETTING OFF WITH SOME GIRL

YOU WONT FIND ME, LAPD
THERE ARE MORE
THERE ARE MANY
AND THEY ARE ALL MINE FOR THE TAKING.

THIS LETTER MUST BE PUBLISHED IN THE LA TIMES ON THE FRONT PAGE. IF IT IS NOT DONE SO BEFORE THE WEEKEND, I WILL GO ON A RAMPAGE. I AM STARTING TO ENJOY THIS. I DO NOT KNOW IF I CAN CONTROL MYSELF.
